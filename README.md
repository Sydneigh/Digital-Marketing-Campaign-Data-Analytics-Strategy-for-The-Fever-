Challenge Kickstarter Analysis with Excel 1 Overview of Project Louise, an up and coming playwright, started a crowdfunding campaign to fund her new play titled Fever. Louise realised that  a data analysis could come in handy to determine campaign key factors in relation to launch dates, funding goals and outcomes of other campaigns. At her request, the analysis compared these key factors to other campaigns and sought out predictors for success. Fortunately her campaign was victorious, and the fundraising goal was met.
